# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.  
It uses the `creditcard.csv` dataset (from Kaggle) which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

## ðŸš€ Steps Involved
1. Data loading & preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Model training (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree)
4. Evaluation using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - ROC-AUC Score
5. Predicting results for unknown data

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Dataset link: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 99.2%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 99.7%

## ðŸ“¬ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
